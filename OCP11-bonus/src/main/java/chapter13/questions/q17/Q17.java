    // What motivations would a developer have for applying the @FunctionalInterface to an interface ?

    // To allow the interface to be used in a lambda expression.
    // +++ To provide documentation to other developers.
    // To allow the interface to be used as a method reference.
    // There is no reason to use this annotation.
    // +++ To trigger a compiler error if the annotation is used incorrectly.
