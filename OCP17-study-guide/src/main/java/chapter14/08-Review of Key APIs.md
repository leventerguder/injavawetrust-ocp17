# Review of Key APIs

The key APIs that you need to know for the exam are listed in Table 14.14. We know some of the classes look similar. You
need to know this table really well before taking the exam.

Additionally, Figure 14.8 shows all of the I/O stream classes that you should be familiar with for the exam, with the
exception of the filter streams. FilterInputStream and FilterOutputStream are high-level superclasses that filter or
transform data. They are rarely used directly.

The InputStreamReader and OutputStreamWriter are incredibly convenient and are also unique in that they are the only I/O
stream classes to have both InputStream/OutputStream and Reader/Writer in their name.
